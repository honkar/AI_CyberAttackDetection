# AI_CyberAttackDetection
This project aims to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between bad connections, called intrusions or attacks, and good normal connections using following models:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines
K-Nearest Neighbors
Fully Connected Neural Network
